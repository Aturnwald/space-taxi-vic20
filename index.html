<p>when I was really young, I've got a VIC-20 with 3K of memory a VC-1541 and a VC-Plotter, also a small colour TV also a few games that I typed in. From this point I learned Basic, Pascal and Assembler.
My friend and me we wrote also a few games and programs for some German magazines and get a small money for that.</p>

<p>Our last and never released project was <strong>Space Taxi</strong>, that we stopped programming because we had no time left, also we get a better computer. But we still played on our old VIC-20.</p>

<p>So, a couple of months ago, we had here in German a really big train disaster, where my friend ( Andy ) died, I was a little injured, but he was death. So in memory of my big friend I finish our last game for the VIC-20</p>

<a id="so-whats-on" class="anchor" href="#so-whats-on" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>So what's on</h3>

<p>everyone knows <strong>Space Taxi</strong> and <strong>the Castle of Doctor Creep</strong> on the C64. I plan to mix this two games together </p>

<h3>
<a id="the-story-of-the-game" class="anchor" href="#the-story-of-the-game" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>the story of the game</h3>

<p>at 1st you start with <strong>Space Taxi</strong> and finish the 1st level, after you leave the screen you fly directly to the 
<strong>Castle of Doctor Creep</strong> where you enter your 1st Level ( picture ) and must finish this, after that you can choose where to fly with your <strong>taxi</strong> for the next Level, it's just a funny mixture</p>

<a id="specials-on-the-game" class="anchor" href="#specials-on-the-game" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Specials on the game</h3>

<p>there is also a level editor included for all of the dungeons, the same as on the C64. 
Also, the screen would be made via <a href="http://www.kahlin.net/daniel/retro/misc/fcbpaint-0.6.zip">Mini-Graphic</a> 
and I try to get a new sound routine for the VIC-20 
the game should be playable on a real VIC-20 with Disk-Drive and 24K/32K, also on all VIC-20 emulators such VICE or PC-VIC or a few others </p>

<p><strong>the 1st alpha comes out during June15, 2016 and it's downloadable here or at <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/space-taxi-vic-20/">surceforge</a></strong></p>
