  "body": "# Welcome to my **Space Taxi**   project side \r\n\r\nwhen I was really young, I've got a VIC-20 with 3K of memory a VC-1541 and a VC-Plotter, also a small colour TV also a few games that I typed in. From this point I learned Basic, Pascal and Assembler.\r\nMy friend and me we wrote also a few games and programs for some German magazines and get a small money for that.\r\n\r\nOur last and never released project was **Space Taxi**, that we stopped programming because we had no time left, also we get a better computer. But we still played on our old VIC-20.\r\n\r\nSo, a couple of months ago, we had here in German a really big train disaster, where my friend ( Andy ) died, I was a little injured, but he was death. So in memory of my big friend I finish our last game for the VIC-20\r\n\r\n### So what's on  \r\neveryone knows **Space Taxi** and **the Castle of Doctor Creep** on the C64. I plan to mix this two games together \r\n\r\n### the story of the game\r\n\r\nat 1st you start with **Space Taxi** and finish the 1st level, after you leave the screen you fly directly to the \r\n**Castle of Doctor Creep** where you enter your 1st Level ( picture ) and must finish this, after that you can choose where to fly with your **taxi** for the next Level, it's just a funny mixture\r\n\r\n### Specials on the game\r\n\r\nthere is also a level editor included for all of the dungeons, the same as on the C64. \r\nAlso, the screen would be made via [Mini-Graphic](http://www.kahlin.net/daniel/retro/misc/fcbpaint-0.6.zip) \r\nand I try to get a new sound routine for the VIC-20 \r\nthe game should be playable on a real VIC-20 with Disk-Drive and 24K/32K, also on all VIC-20 emulators such VICE or PC-VIC or a few others \r\n\r\n**the 1st alpha comes out during June15, 2016 and it's downloadable here or at [surceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/space-taxi-vic-20/)**\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble, questions and all other stuff feel free to contact me under [wiki](https://sourceforge.net/p/space-taxi-vic-20/wiki/Home/) or by mail at: aturnwald@eclipso.at\r\n",
